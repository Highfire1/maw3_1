### Movement rules
The engine accumulates Heat.
The engine can store up to 30 Heat at once.
Time to generate heat depends on how much heat is in the engine:
Heat is required for The Explorer to function.

| Cur. Heat | Time to generate Heat |
| --------- | --------------------- |
| 0-15      | 1 min                 |
| 15-20     | 30s                   |
| 20-25     | 12s                   |
| 25-27     | 6s                    |
| 28-30     | 3s                      |

Heat is used in the following ways:
- 1 Heat / 6s burrowing through stone/debris
- 1 Heat each time Fire Shield is activated
- 5 Heat on a direct collision


| Heat  | Movement Speed |
| ----- | -------------- |
| 0-15  | 0ft/s          |
| 15-20 | 15ft/s         |
| 20-25 | 30ft/s         |
| 25-30 | 60ft/s         |
Every additional heat past 30 grants an extra 5ft/s movement speed underground to a max of 120ft/s
