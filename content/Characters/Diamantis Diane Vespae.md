Dear Mrs. Vespae,


We unregretfully inform you that we will not be offering a boothing location to your stall at this upcoming tenday. Despite your repeated queries and attempted bribery of the Zhentarim organizing officials, your "stall" is completely unpresentable and would ail the good health and manners of the general public. 

Thank you for your understanding,
Sword Coast Trader's Bank and Fine Holdings
