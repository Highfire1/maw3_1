### The Cast

**The Party**
- self explanatory

Sword Coast Trader's Bank and Fine Holdings
- a cute puppet for preserving a veneer of legitimacy

Manshoon (and his mystical Menagerie)
- an animatronic double of manshoon that is programmed to not be able to do any evil
- the zhents created him as a warning to other zhentarim to not fall to the fallacies of the past should manshoon ever rise again
	- something something cold war style propoganda
- under a gaes to harm no one 
- (warforged 5)
- will cooperate with the party if they cast remove curse/greater restoration and attempt to get their help to re-take over the zhentarim
- he has a zhentarim goon as handler who is snarky and 


Zhentarim leader 
- undertaken the arduous task of drilling into the underdark
- has many goons and a drilling machine

Vane Air
- provided the engine for the drilling machine

Valour Gyldstagen (the real one)
- was in the underdark six months ago to film the fourth season of his tv show - Valour: The Eclipsing Justicar for an underground scene in Hjelsgard where he could shine as bright as the sun
- Unbeknownst to the general public, he was abducted to Skullport and got his brain eaten by an intellect devourer
- He was last seen six months ago at Fleetswake, festival of the sea, and he was seen sailing away in a cargo ship
- In fact, the cargo ship turned around and sailed to waterdeep.
- This ship was obtained on short notice from Arnagus Shipwrights

Arnagus Shipwrights
- in return for the usage of its ship on short notice, Arnagus demanded a repayment, which eventually came from the zhentarim offering an opportunity to talk directly to the extremely wealthy of waterdeep

Seadeep
- as mechahalaster rose from the underdark, the neothelid escaped and wiped out much of the githyanki
- Extremiton was able to consolidate his power and transform into an elder brain
- However, the neothelid evaded capture and continued to attack the mind flayer colony
- Extremiton has become paranoid due to the constant neothelid attacks and barely lets anyone leave seadeep, meaning the mind flayers are starving
- The mind flayer colony has since slowly been depleted by the neothelid and its frequent attacks 
- eventually, the diamond which powered the force generator was stolen by a rogue mind flayer (gresk) and taken to skullport in order to join xanathars guild.


Skullport
- Controlled by a Xanathar
- Convinced a mind flayer to betray its colony in return for all the brains it wants (and protection)
- Sees this as a great opportunity to fragment the zhentarim and wipe out seadeep at once (as the tunnel will create a great path for the city watch and they plan to leave a trail of false evidence straight to seadeep)

The Dragon's Breath
- provided large amounts of alchemist fire for use as mining fluid/weaponry


Bhepel's Bottles, Exotic Wines & Cordials / Hriiat Fine Pastries
- just here for fine dining man
- look i don't have a reason for everything ;=;
- pretend they laced the food if you really care


The Diamond
- name tbd
- originates from Seadeeps
- passed to Xanathars guild then to the Zhentarim as a non-violent distraction
- market value: 50 000 gp
- bigger than fist sized
- slightly pink
- perfect color, cut, clarity and extreme carat weight


### The events leading up to Metropolis at Waterdeep III
- The year is 1950 (in faerun terms)

- The Sword Coast Trader's Bank and Fine Holdings is a bank but they have a auction branch similar to Sotheby or christies
- They are running this event to showcase the diamond and auction some other fine artifacts
- The owner of the diamond is unknown to the public but behind the scenes it is the zhentarim' who unexpectedly discovered the diamond when \[unknown]

- The zhentarim have pressured the sword coast traders bank to hold this exhibit in order to contact various potential collaborators about an expedition to the ruins of Halaster's dungeon in order to find more artifacts
- They have done this as the waterdeep council is catching on to their plans and is in complete opposition to re-entering dotmm at any point as it would threaten the stability of waterdeep.

- the zhentarim are tired of fighting with the other waterdeep council members and have decided to take matters into their own hands.
- They plan to undertake an underground expedition into the ruins of Halaster's domain in order to obtain treasures and valuable items.

- A traditional underground expedition has been tried many times and has come across dead ends or disaster every time, so the zhentarim have decided on a different approach
- an excavation machine.
- since such a massive machine would be impossible to smuggle into waterdeep, they are using public transit to smuggle it into waterdeep
- the following entities have collaborated on this excavation machine in hopes of great riches
	- vane air has supplied the engine
	- zhentarim are staffing this excavation machine
	- sword coast traders are providing cover for launching the excavation machine
	- The Dragon's Breath is an alchemist providing alchemist fire for the running of this machine


- The waterdeep council believes that even though halaster is dead, drilling into his dungeon will cause all sorts of nasty effects as the remnants of the dungeon try to fight off a foreign invader and they have voted against allowing any exploration effort.
- This sort of activity has been banned by a majority vote of the waterdeep council as they quite like their current status as the city of innovation and would really rather not threaten that by digging into ancient waterdeep history
- Additionally, the use of incredibly large amounts of toxic and carcinogenic alchemists fire will likely be a hazard to the citizens of waterdeep

- You may be thinking the the risk of drilling into waterdeep and invoking the ill will of Halaster's Dungeon is not worth the trouble of perhaps more 50 000 gp diamonds.
- You would be correct.

- Look you've read the character outlines at the top of the document, I don't have to spell out the Xanathar guild's twist involvement right its 6 am i wanna sleep ðŸ˜­

- This bemusing course of activity (for an orphanage no less!) from the zhentarim is
