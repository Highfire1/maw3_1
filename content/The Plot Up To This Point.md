### Metropolis at Metrotown I
- The year is 2010s and the location is Waterdeep
- Our bold adventurers arrive at beautiful, newly christened tower, set to be Waterdeep's newest shopping and entertainment district.
- General chaos occurs as everyone in the mall suddenly falls asleep.
- The few shoppers strong enough to withstand ~~Sleep 5e~~ this mysterious occurrence band together to investigate this unexpected occurrence.
- These shoppers are as follows:
	- Chumash Sherman, an aaracokra rogue, and also a old grandpa going grocery shopping
	- Wylliam Zenuveer, an elf wizard, and also a husband getting an anniversary gift
	- Veril, an elf rogue (CN) who is going shopping with his goons
	- Elevyn, an undead warlock who is a mall cop 
- They defeat floor after floor of enemies and eventually make it to the top, uncovering a heinous plot to revive Halaster, the Mad Mage. 
- They stop Edwill Vane, the CEO of the tower before he can destroy waterdeep with a thingamajig

### Metropolis at Metrotown II
- Some minor retcons later...
- 
- After his defeat in *Dungeon of the Mad Mage*, Halaster Blackcloak ejected his soul into space
- In a misguided attempt to retrieve this unknown source of great power, the waterdeep council, zhentarim, black network and vane air launch a mission to retrieve this magical orb.
- im not copy pasting all the lore from the onenote
- basically conflict on ground and then everyone GOES TO SPACE
- and then THEY FIGHT HALASTER IN SPACE
- AND WIN!
- also there's factions and crazy stuff
