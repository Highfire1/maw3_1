Motivations for engaging with the plot:
Valour: to gain money and fame
Maria: peace via warfare
Diane: revenge on the traders / alchemic curiosity
Axil: roped in by the zhentarim


Lore drops:

mo:
- valour was last sighted leaving waterdeep via port 

axil:
- the pay for the job tonight is abnormally high, even for an event of this scale

maria:
- as rogue (inquisitive), the zhentarim holding an event for charity is extremely suspicious

xanaphia
- you are on the track of some sus mind flayer activity

diane
- rejected from the gala by some zhentarim officials
- someone has been buying all the alchemists fire in waterdeep
- The dragon's breath is an alchemical store that got a stall but not you ig lmao
